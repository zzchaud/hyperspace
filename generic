							<p>I am a current student at UMBC pursuing CS and looking to minor in BTA, I am originally from Pakistan, but was born and raised in America. I enjoy playing basketball and watching the NFL, as well. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, and spedning time with my friends. I live at home and commute to college with my two parents and my brother. 
								I am deeply passionate about becoming a better coder and continuously improving my skills to tackle more complex and innovative projects. My ultimate goal is to secure an internship at a Fortune 500 company next summer, where I can apply my knowledge, gain invaluable experience, and contribute to impactful work.

I have a solid foundation in coding, having taken multiple Python and coding courses at my university. These courses have equipped me with the technical skills and problem-solving abilities necessary for a successful career in software development. To further hone my expertise, I am currently researching data analytics, a field that fascinates me due to its potential to drive data-driven decision-making and uncover hidden insights.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have practical experience in creating and managing an online business. I built a website for this business, which not only showcases my coding skills but also demonstrates my ability to apply them in real-world scenarios. This venture has taught me the importance of user experience, efficient design, and the integration of various technologies to achieve a seamless online presence.

I am committed to generating impactful projects that reflect my growth as a coder. By working on diverse and challenging projects, I aim to develop a robust portfolio that showcases my versatility and creativity. My dedication to continuous learning and practical application will undoubtedly prepare me for a successful internship and, ultimately, a rewarding career in the tech industry.
